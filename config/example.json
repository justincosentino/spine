/*

JSON Configuration file for SPINE application generation. Used to specify 
surveys that should be included in the application. Should be of the form:

  [
    {
      title: '',
      desc:  '',
      label: '',
      questions: []
    },

    {
      ...
    }

  ]

Questions should be an array of JSON objects. Finalized types will come soon.
